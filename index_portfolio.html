        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a second-year B.Tech student, I’m passionate about learning and embracing new challenges. This year has been a fantastic opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and grow, both personally and professionally. While I’m still learning and exploring the tech world, I’ve been actively involved in extracurriculars that have shaped my leadership, communication, and team coordination skills.</p>
